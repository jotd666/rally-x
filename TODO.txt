implement scrolling: in progress, scroll table probably not adapted
main playfield too wide (2 tiles on the right, hide with other playfield: write the other playfield 2 tiles before?)
implement sprites: X ok, clut OK, Y not working
sprites & second (status) playfield palette: make it distinct


only 1 flag displayed in the radar
round number not displayed

memory overlapping between status and main? (bottom of status memory seem the same as main, check on MAME)
compare memory after maze drawn MAME/amiga

ECS: try to reduce colors: would work. Create separate AGA & OCS versions
