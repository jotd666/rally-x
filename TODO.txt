implement scrolling: in progress, scroll table probably not adapted
main playfield too wide (2 tiles on the right, hide with other playfield: write the other playfield 2 tiles before?)
implement sprites: X ok, clut OK
sprites & second (status) playfield palette: make it distinct

only 9 flags displayed on the radar!

memory overlapping between status and main? (bottom of status memory seem the same as main, check on MAME)
compare memory after maze drawn MAME/amiga

8380: last line "ROUND xxx" , 83A0: not displayed. 26 rows max

8180->8328 status radar

ECS: try to reduce colors: would work. Create separate AGA & OCS versions
